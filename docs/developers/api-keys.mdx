Integrate all functionalities provided by Numeraire into your applications, with the [Numeraire API](https://api.numeraire.tech/docs) using API Keys.

API Keys are used to authenticate requests. They are generated in the [Dashboard](https://app.numeraire.tech) and can be used to access the API endpoints.
When deploying your own Numeraire SwissKnife, you also have access to the API in the same way by connecting to your own instance.
With the right permissions, you also access the API on behalf of other users as an admin, allowing you to behave as banking infrastructure for your users.

## Generate an API token

1. Go to your [Settings](https://app.numeraire.tech/settings?tab=apikeys) on the API Keys tab.

<div class="center-container" style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>

    alt="Numeraire SwissKnife"
  />
</div>

2. Click on the `New` button.

<div class="center-container" style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
  <img
    src="/img/article_images/developers/apikeys_new.png"
    alt="Numeraire SwissKnife"
  />
</div>

3. Fill in the form and select the permissions you want to grant. As user, you can only generate an API key to access your own account.
4. Once the token is generated, copy it and store it in a safe place. You will not be able to see it again!

## Use your API token

Once your API key is generated, you can pass the token in the `Api-Key` header of your requests.

```bash
curl https://api.numeraire.tech/v1/payments -H 'Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

:::tip
Always send payload data in JSON format using the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
