Numeraire SwissKnife is a wallet and transaction orchestrator enabling easy integration of Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr and smart contract protocols to any entity that wishes so without the complexities of above technologies.

Running your own SwissKnife instance allows you to be self-sovereign, have full control over your funds and privacy and participate in the Bitcoin network in a trustless way. We highly recommend
installing SwissKnife on your own hardware, either on your desktop, on a Raspberry Pi or on a server in the cloud. If you don't want to be bothered, you can use the [Numeraire Dashboard](https://app.numeraire.tech), which is essentially the SwissKnife ran as a service.
