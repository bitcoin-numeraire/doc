Numeraire SwissKnife supports multiple Lightning Network providers. The choice of provider depends on your needs and preferences regarding
ease of use, privacy and sovereignty.

You can manage your node through the dashboard or the REST API.

:::tip
The simplest way to get started with Numeraire SwissKnife is to use the **Breez** Lightning provider and get your own Lightning node up
and running in minutes in a non-custodial way in the Blockstream Greenlight cloud.
