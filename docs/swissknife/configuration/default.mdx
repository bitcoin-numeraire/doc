Here is the default configuration file for Numeraire SwissKnife. You can find it on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-numeraire/swissknife/blob/main/config/default.toml) as well.

:::note
The default configuration file is a `toml` file. SwissKnife supports `toml`, `yaml` and `json` config files.
:::

Some optional and sensitive values are not added to the default configuration file. You can find them in the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/bitcoin-numeraire/swissknife/blob/main/.env.example) file and in the [configuration values](swissknife/configuration/index.mdx#configuration-values).

This file should ideally not be modified directly. Instead, you should create a new configuration file (called `development.toml` or `production.toml`) and override the default values.
You can find more information on how to do this in the [configuration guide](swissknife/configuration/index.mdx).
