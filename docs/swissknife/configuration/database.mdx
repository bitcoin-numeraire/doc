Numeraire SwissKnife supports multiple SQL databases by using the powerful Rust ORM, [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/) under the hood.

Tested with PostgreSQL, we are confident the implementation should work with SQLite (testing soon), MySQL or MariaDB.

See the configuration values for the database [here](swissknife/configuration/index.mdx#database).
