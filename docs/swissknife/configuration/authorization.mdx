Numeraire SwissKnife has Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented for authorization.
The permissions are added to the user's JWT token and are checked on each request.

## Permissions

Permissions are defined in the `permissions` field of the user's JWT token.
The permissions are a list of strings, each representing a permission and are checked against the requested endpoint and method.

It is the responsibility of the client's authentication provider (Auth0, Supabase, etc.) to add the permissions to the JWT token.
When using the [`sign-in`](https://api.numeraire.tech/docs#tag/authentication/POST/v1/auth/sign-in) endpoint, all permissions are added to the JWT token, the user acting as a superuser.

### Example

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  ...,
  "permissions": [
    "read:transactions"
  ]
}
```
In this example, the user has the permissions to read transactions.

To see the permissions required for each endpoint, check the [API documentation](https://api.numeraire.tech/docs).
