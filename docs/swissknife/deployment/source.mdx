There are numerous ways to build Numeraire SwissKnife from source. You can either download the artifacts from the release
page [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-numeraire/swissknife/releases) or clone the repository (we recommend checking out the desired release and not use `main` directly).

## Cargo

A common way is to use the [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) package manager, which is the Rust programming language's official package manager.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-numeraire/swissknife.git
cd swissknife
cargo build --release
```

## Docker

Another way is to use Docker. You can build the Docker image with the following command from the Makefile.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-numeraire/swissknife.git
cd swissknife
make build-docker
```

Once the image is built, you can run it with the following command.

```bash
make run-docker
```
