**Numeraire Technologies** is a Bitcoin development company focused on increasing Bitcoin adoption (making it the de facto [_numeraire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire)). To do so, we develop products and services on different Bitcoin related technologies (Mining, Lightning, Nostr and RGB smart contracts).

## Our Products

Currently, Numeraire proposes different products and services for individuals and companies willing to integrate Bitcoin in a simple and flexible way, either custodially for ease of use, or self-custodially for maximum control, privacy and sovereignty.

Registering a [Numeraire Account](account/index.mdx) allows you to:

- Send and receive Bitcoin through the Lightning Network
- Register a LN and Nostr Address (*your_username@numeraire.tech*)
- Send and Receive Zaps on Nostr
- Access your account programmatically via API Keys
- As a developer, integrate Bitcoin into your app with the [REST API](https://api.numeraire.tech/docs)
